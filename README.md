# Diffusion_MixedBC_PDE
Numerical Solution of Diffusion PDE with Mixed Boundary Conditions
This project implements a finite difference method to solve the 1D diffusion equation under mixed (Dirichletâ€“Neumann) boundary conditions. The code allows customization of diffusion coefficients, time steps, spatial discretization, and boundary values. Designed for both educational and research purposes, it demonstrates the impact of different boundary conditions on the diffusion process. Analytical comparisons and visualization tools are included for verification and interpretation of results.
